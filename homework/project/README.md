# Pacman

## Thanks

  The basic logic codes are refractored from Platzh1rsch's pacman which initally built by using canvas. (https://github.com/platzhersh/pacman-canvas).
  
  The figures codes are refactored from threex.pacman which initially use canvas to draw the face. I create png textures instead. (https://github.com/jeromeetienne/threex.pacman).
  
  The orbit control and window resize codes comes from stemkoski's GitHub (https://github.com/stemkoski/stemkoski.github.com).
